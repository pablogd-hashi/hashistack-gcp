# Service Intentions Demo - k8s-southwest1 Admin Partition
## Development to Production Promotion with CTS Automation

**Customer Story**: Demonstrate governance-driven service promotion from development to production with automated infrastructure updates through Consul Terraform Sync (CTS).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this demo, ensure you have completed the following setup:

### 1. Admin Partitions Setup
This demo requires Consul Enterprise admin partitions to be properly configured. Follow the complete setup guide:

**📖 [Admin Partitions Setup Guide](../admin-partitions/README.md)**

Key requirements:
- ✅ DC1 HashiStack cluster deployed with Consul Enterprise
- ✅ GKE clusters configured as admin partition clients
- ✅ k8s-southwest1 admin partition created and connected
- ✅ Consul Connect service mesh enabled
- ✅ Cross-partition networking configured

### 2. Nomad API Gateway Deployment
The demo uses a Nomad-deployed API Gateway for external access. Deploy it following:

**📖 [API Gateway Deployment Guide](../../nomad-apps/api-gw.nomad/README.md)**

Key requirements:
- ✅ API Gateway running in Nomad cluster (port 8081)
- ✅ HTTP listener configured for external traffic
- ✅ Consul integration enabled for service discovery
- ✅ Gateway registered in Consul service catalog

### 3. Environment Validation

Verify your setup is ready:

```bash
# Check admin partition connectivity
export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="http://<dc1-server-ip>:8500"
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="<bootstrap-token>"
consul partition list

# Check API Gateway is running
nomad job status my-api-gateway
consul catalog services | grep api-gateway

# Check GKE cluster connectivity
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n consul
```

**Expected Results:**
- Consul should show `k8s-southwest1` partition in the list
- Nomad should show `my-api-gateway` job as running
- API Gateway should be registered in Consul services
- GKE cluster should have Consul pods running

## Architecture Overview

```
k8s-southwest1 Admin Partition
├── Development Namespace (testing)
├── Production Namespace (live traffic via API Gateway)
├── API Gateway (port 8081, external access)
├── Mesh Gateway (service exports)
└── CTS (watches intentions → updates load balancer)
```

## Step 1: Setup ACL Policies and Tokens

**What we're doing**: Creating permission boundaries for development and production teams using Consul Enterprise ACL policies. Development gets full access to their namespace, production gets additional permissions for CTS and gateways.

**Expected outcome**: Two distinct ACL tokens that enforce namespace isolation while enabling the required integrations.

```bash
# Development policy
cat > dev-policy.hcl << 'EOF'
partition_prefix "" {
  namespace "development" {
    service_prefix "" {
      policy = "write"
      intentions = "write"
    }
    node_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Production policy with CTS permissions
cat > prod-policy.hcl << 'EOF'
partition_prefix "" {
  namespace "production" {
    service_prefix "" {
      policy = "write"
      intentions = "write"
    }
    node_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    key_prefix "cts/" {
      policy = "write"
    }
  }
  namespace "production" {
    service "api-gateway" {
      policy = "write"
    }
    service "mesh-gateway" {
      policy = "write"
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Create policies and tokens
consul acl policy create -name "dev-policy" -rules @dev-policy.hcl
consul acl policy create -name "prod-policy" -rules @prod-policy.hcl

export DEV_TOKEN=$(consul acl token create -policy-name "dev-policy" -format json | jq -r .SecretID)
export PROD_TOKEN=$(consul acl token create -policy-name "prod-policy" -format json | jq -r .SecretID)

echo "Development token: $DEV_TOKEN"
echo "Production token: $PROD_TOKEN"
```

**Verification**: 
- You should see two policy creation confirmations
- Two tokens should be displayed
- Test with: `consul acl token read -id $DEV_TOKEN` should show development policy attached

## Step 2: Deploy Minimal Boutique to Development

**What we're doing**: Deploying a **minimal version** of Google's Online Boutique (5 core services) to the k8s-southwest1 partition development namespace with Consul Connect sidecar injection. This avoids xDS stream limits while providing a working e-commerce demo.

**Expected outcome**: Five pods running in development namespace, all registered in Consul service catalog with Connect sidecars.

```bash
# Create development namespace
kubectl create namespace development

# Deploy minimal boutique services (5 services to avoid xDS limits)
cat > boutique-minimal.yaml << 'EOF'

kubectl apply -f boutique-minimal.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=frontend -n development --timeout=300s
```

**Verification**:
- `kubectl get pods -n development` should show 5 pods with 2/2 ready (frontend, productcatalogservice, cartservice, currencyservice, redis-cart)
- `consul catalog services -partition k8s-southwest1 -namespace development` should list all 5 services
- Check Connect sidecars: `kubectl get pods -n development -o wide` should show 2/2 containers per pod
- **Basic functionality test**: `kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80 -n development` and browse to http://localhost:8080

## Step 3: Apply Zero Trust and Fix with Service Intentions

**What we're doing**: Testing that our minimal app works normally, then applying Consul's zero-trust model (default deny all traffic), observing it break, then fixing it with minimal service intentions for the 5-service deployment.

**Expected outcome**: App works → App breaks with zero trust → App works again with minimal service intentions.

```bash
# Set development context
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="$DEV_TOKEN"
export CONSUL_PARTITION="k8s-southwest1"
export CONSUL_NAMESPACE="development"

# Test working app first
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80 -n development &
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -q "Online Boutique" && echo "✅ Minimal app working"

# Apply zero trust (breaks app)
consul intention create -deny -source "*" -destination "*" -description "Zero trust default deny"
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -q "error\|timeout\|failed" && echo "❌ App broken by zero trust"

# Fix with minimal service intentions (5 services only)
echo "Creating minimal frontend service intentions..."
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "productcatalogservice" -description "Frontend needs product catalog" -meta "environment=development,cts_managed=true"
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "currencyservice" -description "Frontend needs currency conversion" -meta "environment=development,cts_managed=true" 
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "cartservice" -description "Frontend needs cart access" -meta "environment=development,cts_managed=true"

echo "Creating backend service intentions..."
consul intention create -allow -source "cartservice" -destination "redis-cart" -description "Cart needs Redis storage" -meta "environment=development,cts_managed=true"

sleep 10
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -q "Online Boutique" && echo "✅ Minimal app functionality restored with 4 service intentions"
```

**Verification**:
- **Step 1**: Curl should return HTML containing "Online Boutique" with basic e-commerce functionality
- **Step 2**: After default deny, curl should timeout or show connection errors
- **Step 3**: After 4 minimal intentions, app should work: browse products, view cart, see currency conversion
- `consul intention list` should show exactly 4 allow intentions for minimal service communication
- **Basic test**: Browse to http://localhost:8080, add items to cart - core features should work

## Step 4: Setup Consul Terraform Sync (CTS) with HCP Terraform

## 🧪 Testing Instructions - HCP Terraform Integration

### Prerequisites Checklist:
- [ ] Consul Enterprise running on GCP with k8s-southwest1 partition
- [ ] **CTS Enterprise** (required for HCP Terraform integration)
- [ ] HCP Terraform account with "pablogd-hcp-test" organization
- [ ] GKE-southwest workspace exists and is in **CLI-driven mode**
- [ ] HCP Terraform API token with workspace permissions

### Step-by-Step Testing:

#### 1. Prepare HCP Terraform Workspace
```bash
# Go to HCP Terraform UI:
# https://app.terraform.io/app/pablogd-hcp-test/workspaces/GKE-southwest
# Ensure workspace is in "CLI-driven" mode (Settings → General → Execution Mode)
```

#### 2. Set Authentication Token
```bash
# Get your HCP Terraform API token from:
# https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens
export TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io="your-hcp-terraform-api-token-here"
```

#### 3. Start CTS with HCP Integration
```bash
cd /Users/pablod/Documents/Infrastructure/nomad/02-consul-nomad-gcp/hashistack-gcp/consul/demo-all

# Start CTS Enterprise with HCP Terraform integration
consul-terraform-sync start -config-file=consul-terraform-sync.hcl &

# Wait for startup
sleep 15

# Check CTS status
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status | jq '.status'
```

#### 4. Test Service Discovery + Automatic Firewall Creation
```bash
# Deploy test service on port 8085 (your customer requirement!)
kubectl create deployment test-service-8085 --image=nginx --port=8085 -n production
kubectl expose deployment test-service-8085 --port=8085 --target-port=8085 -n production

# Annotate for Consul service mesh registration
kubectl patch deployment test-service-8085 -n production -p '{
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "metadata": {
        "annotations": {
          "consul.hashicorp.com/connect-inject": "true",
          "consul.hashicorp.com/partition": "k8s-southwest1",
          "consul.hashicorp.com/namespace": "production"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'

# Wait for service registration and CTS detection
echo "⏳ Waiting for service registration and CTS automation..."
sleep 90

# Check CTS triggered HCP Terraform run
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status/tasks | jq '.tasks[0]'

# Monitor HCP Terraform workspace
echo "🚀 Check your workspace for the triggered run:"
echo "https://app.terraform.io/app/pablogd-hcp-test/workspaces/GKE-southwest"
```

#### 5. Verify Success
```bash
# Expected results:
# ✅ CTS should show successful task execution
# ✅ HCP Terraform workspace should show new run
# ✅ GCP firewall rule should be created for port 8085
# ✅ Service should be reachable through the firewall

echo "🔥 SUCCESS: New service on port 8085 triggered automatic firewall rule creation!"
```

### Troubleshooting:
- **CTS fails to start**: Check token and workspace mode
- **No HCP runs triggered**: Verify service registration in Consul
- **Terraform errors**: Check GCP permissions in HCP workspace variables

## Step 4: Setup Consul Terraform Sync (CTS)

**What we're doing**: Setting up CTS to watch for service intention changes in production and automatically update infrastructure. CTS runs locally on your laptop and connects to the Consul servers.

**Expected outcome**: CTS service running locally and ready to respond to service intention changes in the k8s-southwest1 partition.

**CTS Installation (run on your laptop):**
```bash
# Install CTS binary on your laptop
curl -fsSL https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-terraform-sync/0.7.0/consul-terraform-sync_0.7.0_darwin_arm64.zip -o cts.zip
unzip cts.zip
sudo mv consul-terraform-sync /usr/local/bin/
```

**CTS Configuration:**
```bash
# Set your GCP Consul server details
export CONSUL_SERVER_IP="<your-dc1-server-ip>"  # Your DC1 server IP
export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="http://$CONSUL_SERVER_IP:8500"

curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status | jq '.status' && echo "✅ CTS running with HCP Terraform backend"
```

**Verification**:
- CTS should start without errors (check logs if needed)
- `curl http://localhost:8558/v1/status` should return JSON with status information
- You should see "✅ CTS running with HCP Terraform backend" message
- CTS is configured to watch the 5 minimal boutique services
- **HCP Terraform Integration**: CTS will execute Terraform runs in your existing `GKE-southwest` workspace
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure your workspace is in CLI-driven mode in HCP Terraform

**Demonstrating CTS Infrastructure Automation with HCP Terraform:**

```bash
# 1. Check initial CTS task status
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status/tasks | jq '.tasks[0].status'

# 2. Trigger infrastructure update by scaling services (simulates service changes)
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=3 -n production
kubectl scale deployment productcatalogservice --replicas=2 -n production

# 3. Wait for CTS to detect changes and trigger HCP Terraform run
sleep 60  # HCP Terraform runs take longer than local execution

# 4. Check that CTS executed Terraform in your HCP workspace
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status/tasks | jq '.tasks[0]'

# 5. Monitor HCP Terraform workspace for the actual run
echo "🚀 Check your HCP Terraform workspace for the triggered run:"
echo "https://app.terraform.io/app/pablogd-hcp-test/workspaces/GKE-southwest"

# 6. Example: Deploy new service on port 8085 to demonstrate automatic firewall rule creation
kubectl create deployment test-service --image=nginx --port=8085 -n production
kubectl expose deployment test-service --port=8085 --target-port=8085 -n production

# 7. Wait for service registration and CTS to detect the new service
sleep 90

# 8. Check CTS status - should show new Terraform run triggered
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status/tasks | jq '.tasks[0]'
echo "🔥 New service on port 8085 should trigger automatic firewall rule creation!"
```

**What This Demonstrates:**
- **HCP Terraform Integration**: CTS triggers actual Terraform runs in your existing workspace
- **Real Infrastructure Updates**: Firewall rules are created/updated in your GKE cluster
- **Service Discovery Integration**: CTS monitors Consul service registry
- **Customer Requirement**: New service on port 8085 → automatic firewall rule creation
- **Enterprise-Grade Automation**: Uses your existing HCP Terraform workflows and permissions
- **Zero-Touch Network Policy**: Services automatically become reachable through firewall automation

## Step 5: Promote to Production

**What we're doing**: Taking our tested minimal application from development and promoting it to the production namespace. This simulates the real-world workflow where code moves through environments.

**Expected outcome**: Same 5-service application now running in production namespace, ready for production-grade service intentions.

```bash
# Create production namespace
kubectl create namespace production

# Deploy minimal boutique to production (k8s-southwest1 partition)
sed 's/namespace: development/namespace: production/g' boutique-minimal.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=frontend -n production --timeout=300s

echo "✅ Minimal boutique promoted to production namespace"
```

**Verification**:
- `kubectl get pods -n production` should show 5 pods (frontend, productcatalogservice, cartservice, currencyservice, redis-cart) with 2/2 ready
- `consul catalog services -partition k8s-southwest1 -namespace production` should show services in production namespace
- You should see the success message about promotion

## Step 6: Configure API Gateway

**What we're doing**: Setting up Consul's API Gateway to provide external access to our production services in the k8s-southwest1 partition. This creates a controlled entry point that we can secure with service intentions.

**Expected outcome**: API Gateway configured to route external traffic to internal services via service mesh.

```bash
# Set production context
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="$PROD_TOKEN"
export CONSUL_NAMESPACE="production"

# API Gateway configuration for k8s-southwest1
cat > api-gateway-config.hcl << 'EOF'
Kind = "api-gateway"
Name = "boutique-gateway"
Partition = "k8s-southwest1"
Namespace = "production"

Listeners = [
  {
    Name = "boutique-listener"
    Port = 8081
    Protocol = "http"
    
    Routes = [
      {
        Name = "boutique-route"
        Match = { HTTP = { PathPrefix = "/boutique/" } }
        Services = [
          {
            Name = "frontend"
            Namespace = "production"
            Partition = "k8s-southwest1"
          }
        ]
        Filters = { URLRewrite = { PathPrefix = "/" } }
      }
    ]
  }
]
EOF

consul config write api-gateway-config.hcl
echo "✅ API Gateway configured for k8s-southwest1 external access"
```

**Verification**:
- `consul config read -kind api-gateway -name boutique-gateway` should show your gateway configuration
- Gateway should be configured for k8s-southwest1 partition
- Routes should be configured to forward `/boutique/` traffic to frontend service

## Step 7: Production Service Intentions with CTS Integration

**What we're doing**: Applying production-grade service intentions for our minimal 5-service deployment that include metadata for CTS automation. These intentions control service communication and trigger infrastructure updates through CTS.

**Expected outcome**: Zero-trust production environment with explicit service communication permissions for minimal boutique services.

```bash
# Apply production zero trust
consul intention create -deny -source "*" -destination "*" -description "Production zero trust"

# Create minimal production service intentions with CTS metadata
echo "Creating production frontend service intentions (minimal set)..."
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "productcatalogservice" -description "Production: Frontend to product catalog" -meta "environment=production,cts_managed=true,destination_port=3550"
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "currencyservice" -description "Production: Frontend to currency service" -meta "environment=production,cts_managed=true,destination_port=7000"
consul intention create -allow -source "frontend" -destination "cartservice" -description "Production: Frontend to cart service" -meta "environment=production,cts_managed=true,destination_port=7070"

echo "Creating backend service intentions..."
consul intention create -allow -source "cartservice" -destination "redis-cart" -description "Production: Cart to Redis storage" -meta "environment=production,cts_managed=true,destination_port=6379"

# Trigger CTS update for production infrastructure
consul kv put "cts/production/intentions/last_update" "$(date -Iseconds)"
consul kv put "cts/production/intentions/services_count" "5"
echo "🔧 CTS triggered - load balancer updating for minimal boutique services..."

sleep 30
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status | jq '.tasks[0].status' && echo "✅ CTS execution complete - infrastructure updated for minimal application"
```

**Verification**:
- `consul intention list` in production namespace should show 4 allow intentions for minimal service communication
- CTS status should show successful task execution with infrastructure updates for service ports: 3550, 7000, 7070, 6379
- Check intentions metadata: `consul intention list -detailed` should show CTS-related metadata and port information
- **Minimal production test**: Access via API Gateway should provide core e-commerce functionality
- **Port verification**: CTS should have updated load balancer for the 4 core service ports

## Step 8: Configure Service Exports

**What we're doing**: Configuring service exports to make selected production services from our minimal boutique available to other Consul partitions via mesh gateway. This enables controlled cross-partition service sharing.

**Expected outcome**: Minimal production services available for consumption by other partitions through secure mesh gateway connections.

```bash
# Service export configuration for minimal boutique
cat > service-exports.hcl << 'EOF'
Kind = "exported-services"
Name = "boutique-exports"
Partition = "k8s-southwest1"

Services = [
  {
    Name = "frontend"
    Namespace = "production"
    Consumers = [
      { Partition = "analytics-cluster" },
      { Partition = "mobile-backend" }
    ]
  },
  {
    Name = "productcatalogservice"
    Namespace = "production"
    Consumers = [
      { Partition = "analytics-cluster" },
      { Partition = "mobile-backend" },
      { Partition = "partner-integrations" }
    ]
  },
  {
    Name = "currencyservice"
    Namespace = "production"
    Consumers = [
      { Partition = "mobile-backend" },
      { Partition = "partner-integrations" }
    ]
  }
]

Meta = {
  "cts_managed" = "true"
  "mesh_gateway_integration" = "enabled"
  "minimal_deployment" = "true"
}
EOF

consul config write service-exports.hcl
echo "✅ Minimal boutique services exported via mesh gateway"
```

**Verification**:
- `consul config read -kind exported-services -name boutique-exports` should show your export configuration with 3 minimal services
- **Services exported**: frontend, productcatalogservice, currencyservice (core business logic)
- **Consumer partitions**: analytics-cluster, mobile-backend, partner-integrations
- Mesh gateway should be configured to handle cross-partition traffic for minimal service set

## Step 9: Verify Complete Setup

**What we're doing**: Final verification that all components are working together with our minimal 5-service deployment - checking service intentions across both namespaces, confirming CTS is operational, and validating that our complete governance workflow is in place.

**Expected outcome**: Complete audit trail showing minimal service intentions, CTS automation, and cross-partition exports all functioning together.

```bash
echo "📊 Minimal Boutique Demo Summary:"
echo "================================="

# Show development intentions
export CONSUL_NAMESPACE="development"
echo "Development intentions (minimal set):"
consul intention list

# Show production intentions
export CONSUL_NAMESPACE="production"
echo "Production intentions (minimal set):"
consul intention list

# Show API Gateway status
consul catalog services | grep api-gateway

# Show CTS status
echo "CTS Status:"
curl -s http://localhost:8558/v1/status | jq '.tasks[] | {name, status}'

echo ""
echo "✅ Complete Minimal Demo Achieved:"
echo "- ✅ k8s-southwest1 admin partition with ACL governance"
echo "- ✅ Minimal 5-service boutique deployment (avoids xDS limits)"
echo "- ✅ Development → Production promotion workflow"
echo "- ✅ API Gateway for external access (port 8081)"
echo "- ✅ CTS automation updating load balancer based on intentions"
echo "- ✅ Service exports via mesh gateway (3 core services)"
echo "- ✅ Zero trust with explicit service intentions"
```

**Final Verification Checklist**:
- **Development intentions**: Should see 4 allow intentions for minimal service communication
- **Production intentions**: Should see 4 allow intentions for minimal service stack  
- **CTS status**: Should show successful task execution with infrastructure updates for 4 service ports
- **Service exports**: Should show 3 core services exported to 3 different partitions
- **API Gateway**: Should be configured and routing external traffic to functional minimal e-commerce app
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of 8 service communication approvals across both environments

**Success indicators**:
- **Core e-commerce functionality**: Browse products, add to cart, currency conversion working
- **Zero unauthorized communication**: All service-to-service communication explicitly approved
- **Production-ready**: Infrastructure automation via CTS for minimal service set
- **Cross-cluster ready**: Core services exported and ready for cluster peering demonstrations
- **Scalable foundation**: Can add more services incrementally without hitting xDS limits

**Minimal Boutique Services Ready for Cross-Partition Demo**:
- **Frontend service**: Available to analytics-cluster and mobile-backend partitions
- **Product catalog**: Available to analytics, mobile-backend, and partner-integrations  
- **Currency service**: Available to mobile-backend and partner-integrations

This gives you a solid, working foundation for demonstrating cross-cluster service sharing scenarios with a proven minimal deployment!

## Key Demo Points

1. **Governance**: ACL policies enforce namespace boundaries in k8s-southwest1 partition
2. **Zero Trust**: Default deny with explicit allow intentions for minimal service set
3. **Automation**: CTS watches production intentions and updates infrastructure for 4 core services
4. **External Access**: API Gateway provides controlled entry point to k8s-southwest1
5. **Cross-Partition**: Service exports enable controlled external access for core services
6. **Audit Trail**: All service communication explicitly approved and logged
7. **xDS Limits**: Minimal 5-service deployment avoids Consul 1.21.0 stream limits

## Test the Complete Flow

```bash
# Set your environment to connect directly to GCP Consul
export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="http://<your-dc1-server-ip>:8500"
export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="<your-bootstrap-token>"

# Access minimal boutique via kubectl port-forward (for testing)
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8080:80 -n production &
curl http://localhost:8080

# Or test via API Gateway (if configured)
# curl http://your-api-gateway:8081/boutique/

# CTS monitors and updates load balancer automatically
# When new intentions are created in production for k8s-southwest1 partition
```
